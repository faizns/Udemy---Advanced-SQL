**Steps :**
- Pull weekly sessions from 22 Aug - 29 Nov for gsearch and bsearch, utm campaign nonbrand
- week_start_date | total_session | gsearch_session | bsearch_session

<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT
    MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS total_session,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)  AS gsearch_session,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END)  AS bsearch_session
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-11-29'
    AND utm_source IN ('gsearch', 'bsearch')
    AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY WEEK(created_at);

**Steps :**
- Pull mobile session from 22 Aug - 30 Nov for gsearch and bsearch, utm campaign nonbrand
- utm_source | total_session | mobile_session | percentage_mobile_session

<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT
    utm_source,
    COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS total_session,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN device_type = 'mobile' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_session,

**Steps :**
- Based on device type, pull gsearch and bsearch nonbrand conversion rates (order/session) from 22 Aug - 18 Sep
- device_type | utm_source | total_session | tota_order | percentage_cvr


<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT
    device_type,
    utm_source,
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id) AS total_session,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_order,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id)),2)
        AS percentage_cvr
FROM website_sessions w
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON w.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE w.created_at BETWEEN '2012-08-22' AND '2012-09-18'
    AND utm_source IN ('gsearch', 'bsearch')
    AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
