# **MID COURSE PROJECT**

## ðŸ“‚ **Introduction**
### ðŸ“Œ **The Situation**
Maven Fuzzy Factory has been live for ~8 months, and your CEO is due to present company performance metrics to the board next week. Youâ€™ll be the one tasked with preparing relevant metrics to show the companyâ€™s promising growth.

### ðŸ“Œ **The Objective**
**Use SQL to :** <br>
Extract and analyze website traffic and performance data from the Maven Fuzzy Factory database to quantify the companyâ€™s growth, and to tell the story of how you have been able to generate that growth.

</p>
<br>

- Tell the story of your companyâ€™s growth, using trended performance data
- Use the database to explain some of the details around your growth story, and quantify the revenue impact of some of your wins
- Analyze current performance, and use that data available to assess upcoming opportunities

## ðŸ“‚ **QUESTION**
#### ðŸ’¡*1 - Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?*

**Steps :**
- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders based source is gsearch
- Aggregate to find conversion rate for every month sessions
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(w.created_at),
    MONTH(w.created_at) AS months,
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id)),2) AS percent_cvr
FROM website_sessions w
    LEFT JOIN orders o
        ON w.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE w.created_at < '2012-11-27'
    AND w.utm_source = 'gsearch'
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="450" alt="Q1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216864745-5cbd3d25-5bcc-482f-b0e9-f3a4ca7fbfb8.png"></kbd> <br>
  
  1 â€” Session to orders growth remained stable and saw a steadily increase from March, 3.23% to November, 4.20%.
</p>
<br>

#### ðŸ’¡*2 - Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.*

**Steps :**
- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders based on source is gsearch
- Aggregate to find conversion rate for every month based on campaign
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(w.created_at) AS years,
    MONTH(w.created_at) AS months,
    -- nonbrand
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS nonbrand_orders,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS percent_nonbrand_cvr,
    -- brand
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS brand_orders,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.utm_campaign = 'brand' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS percent_brand_cvr
FROM website_sessions w
    LEFT JOIN orders o
        ON w.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE w.created_at < '2012-11-27'
    AND w.utm_source = 'gsearch'
    AND w.utm_campaign IN ('nonbrand', 'brand')
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="850" alt="Q2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216865217-9d6da421-9d2a-49f9-ae3e-46d6139738a1.png"></kbd> <br>
  
  2 â€” We can see that the percentage of conversion rate of nonbrand campaign steadily grows from 3% to 4%. But, the brand campaign has fluctuating conversion rates/trends every month.

#### ðŸ’¡*3 - While weâ€™re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.*

**Steps :**
- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders based on source is gsearch
- Aggregate to find nonbrand conversion rate for every month based on device type
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
-- find device type
SELECT DISTINCT device_type
FROM website_sessions
-- there are mobile and desktop

-- calculate session and order by device
SELECT
    YEAR(w.created_at) AS years,
    MONTH(w.created_at) AS months,
    -- mobile
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'mobile' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_sessions_nonb,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'mobile' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS mobile_orders_nonb,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'mobile' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'mobile' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS percent_mobile_nonb_cvr,
    -- desktop
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'desktop' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_sessions_nonb,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'desktop' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END) AS desktop_orders_nonb,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'desktop' THEN o.order_id ELSE NULL END)/
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN w.device_type = 'desktop' THEN w.website_session_id ELSE NULL END)),2) AS percent_desktop_nonb_cvr
FROM website_sessions w
    LEFT JOIN orders o
        ON w.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE w.created_at < '2012-11-27'
    AND w.utm_source = 'gsearch'
    AND w.utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="1000" alt="Q3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216865814-2bbd3e05-2104-4ad1-867c-ca76ba161d7a.png"></kbd> <br>
  
  3 â€” The majority of the conversion rate contribution came from desktop users with a good growth from 4.43% in March, it dropped in April to 3.51%, but continued to increase in the following months to reach 5% in November. The contribution with mobile devices is quite low and there is a need to investigate this, it could be that the web accessed through mobile is not user friendly.

#### ðŸ’¡*4 - Iâ€™m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?*

**Step :**
- Find the various utm sources and refers to see the traffic we're getting
- Extract months and aggregate to find each session based on the last output condition
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
-- see traffic we're getting
SELECT DISTINCT
    utm_source,
    utm_campaign,
    http_referer
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-10-27'
```
<br>

<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="400" alt="Q4-1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216866191-03157525-c34b-45ab-8521-0fa3299ceeb5.png"></kbd> <br>
</p>
<br>

From the output we can see:
- Source of traffic from gsearch and bsearch
- Based on the output :
    - If source, campaign, and http referral is NULL, then it is direct traffic: users type in the website link in the browser's search bar.
    - If source and campaign is NULL, but there is http referral, then it is organic search: coming from search engine and not tagged w
<br>

```sql
SELECT
    YEAR(created_at) AS years,
    MONTH(created_at) AS montsh,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'gsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS gsearch_paid_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source = 'bsearch' THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS bsearch_paid_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NOT NULL THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS organic_search_sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN utm_source IS NULL AND http_referer IS NULL THEN website_session_id ELSE NULL END) AS direct_type_in_sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1,2
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="800" alt="Q4-2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216866427-379e23d6-ef69-4d1b-8810-ec46aba72180.png"></kbd> <br>
  
  4 â€” Gsearh is the dominant traffic among other channels. Not only gsearch, each channel also experiences session growth every month.
</p>
<br>

#### ðŸ’¡*5 - Iâ€™d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?*

**Step :**
- Extract month from date, calculate relavant sessions and orders
- Aggregate to find conversion rate for every month sessions
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(w.created_at),
    MONTH(w.created_at) AS months,
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id) AS sessions,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
    ROUND(100*(COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id)),2) AS percent_cvr
FROM website_sessions w
    LEFT JOIN orders o
        ON w.website_session_id = o.website_session_id
WHERE w.created_at < '2012-11-27'
GROUP BY 1, 2
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="450" alt="Q5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216867519-5feaf0b4-9c02-4215-bcf4-db407019c987.png"></kbd> <br>
  
  5 â€” The conversion rate in March was 3.19% and decreased in the next month. The conversion rate started to increase steadily in the following month until it reached 4.40% in November.
</p>
