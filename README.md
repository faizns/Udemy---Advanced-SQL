# **Udemy - Advanced SQL : MySQL Data Analysis and Business Intelligence**

## ðŸ“‚ **Introduction**
### **The Situation**
Youâ€™ve just been hired as an **eCommerce Database Analyst** for **Maven Fuzzy Factory**, an online retailer which has just launched their first product.

### **The Brief**
As a member of the startup team, you will work with the *CEO*, the *Head of Marketing*, and the *Website Manager* to help steer the business.

You will analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches. 

### **The Objectives**
**Use SQL to:**
- Access and explore the Maven Fuzzy Factory database
- Become the data expert for the company, and the go-to person for mission critical analyses
- Analyze and optimize the businessâ€™ marketing channels, website, and product portfolio <br>
<br>

---

## ðŸ“‚ **Overview Database**
We will be working with six related tables, which contain eCommerce data about:
- Website Activity
- Products
- Orders and Refunds

We'll use MySQL to understand how customers access and interact with the site, analyze landing page performance and conversion, and explore product-level sales.

## ðŸ“‚ **Analyzing Traffic Sources**
### ðŸ“Œ **Business Concept: Traffic Source Analysis**
Traffic source analysis is about understanding **where your customers are 
coming from** and **which channels are driving the highest quality traffic.**

### ðŸ“Œ **Common Use Cases: Traffic Source Analysis**
- Analyzing search data and shifting budget towards the engines, campaigns or keywords driving the strongest conversion rates
- Comparing user behavior patterns across traffic sources to inform creative and messaging strategy
- Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted spend or scale high-converting traffic

### **Task**
### **1. Finding Top Traffic Sources**

<p align="center">

</p>
<br>

**Steps :**
- Breakdown of sessions by UTM source, campaign and referring domain
- Filter results up to sessions before **'2012-04-12'** and group results by **utm_source**, **utm_campaign** and **http_referer**
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT 
	utm_source,
	utm_campaign,
	http_referer,
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions
FROM website_sessions
WHERE created_at < '2012-04-12'
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 4 DESC
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">

  1 â€” Most sessions came from gsearch nonbrand campaign traffic. Drill deeper to explore potential optimization opportunities.
</p>

<br>

<br>

### **2. Traffic Conversion Rate**

<p align="center">

</p>
<br>

**Steps :**
- Calculate CVR from **session(COUNT)** to **order(COUNT)**. If CVR < 4% need to reduce bids, otherwise if CVR >= 4% can increase bids to drive more volume
- Filter sessions **< '2012-04-12'**, **utm_source = 'gsearch'** and **utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'**
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id) AS sessions,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS orders,
	COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id)/COUNT(DISTINCT w.website_session_id) AS session_to_order_CVR
FROM website_sessions w
	LEFT JOIN orders o
		ON o.website_session_id = w.website_session_id
WHERE w.created_at < '2012-04-14'
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'
	AND utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'
```
<br>

**Result :**
<p align="center">
  <kbd><img width="380" alt="tabel_traffic_cvr" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115857221/216098251-06f32653-8c9c-478a-83f5-0d286efbdb70.png"> </kbd> <br>
  
  2 â€” The conversion rate is less than 4%, which is 2.88%, hence we have to reduce bids. We should to monitor impact of bid reduction and analyze performance trending by device type in order to refine bidding strategy.

### ðŸ“Œ **Business Concept: Bid Optimization**
Analyzing for bid optimization is about **understanding the value of various 
segments of paid traffic, so that you can optimize your marketing budget**.

### ðŸ“Œ **Common Use Cases: Bid Optimization**
-  Using conversion rate and revenue per click analyses to figure out how much you should spend per click to acquire customers
- Understanding how your website and products perform for various subsegments of traffic (i.e. mobile vs desktop) to optimize within channels 
- Analyzing the impact that bid changes have on your ranking in the auctions, and the volume of customers driven to your site<br>
<br>

### **3. Traffic Source Trending**

<p align="center">

</p>
<br>

**Steps :**
- Calculate trend and impact on sessions for gsearch nonbrand campaign after bidding down on Apr 15, 2021
- Filter to **< '2012-05-10'**, **utm_source = 'gsearch'**, **utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'**
<br>

**Query :**
```sql
SELECT
	MIN(DATE(created_at)) AS week_start_date,
	COUNT(DISTINCT website_session_id) AS sessions
FROM website_sessions 
WHERE created_at < '2012-05-10'
	AND utm_source = 'gsearch'

  3 â€” The sessions after 2021-04-15 have dropped. Continue to monitor session volume. We could make the campaigns more efficient to increase volume again, by maximising volume at the lowest possible bid.

</p>
<br>

**Steps :**
- Calculate the conversion rate from session to order by device type

  4 â€” Desktop bids were driving nearly 4% of the conversion rate, so we should transfer the paid traffic spent to the desktop channel instead.

<br>

</p>
<br>

**Steps :**
- Calculate (with pivot)  weekly session trends for both desktop and mobile after bidding up on the desktop channel on 2012-05-19
- Filter to **between '2012-04-15' to '2012-06-19'**, **utm_source = 'gsearch'**, **utm_campaign = 'nonbrand'**
<br>

**Query :**

  5 â€” Desktop volume increased after bidding on 2012-05-19, but mobile volume dropped dramatically. Focusing on desktops was able to optimize spending efficiently. Continue to monitor device-level volume and be aware of the impact bid levels has. Continue to monitor conversion performance at the device-level to optimize spend.

**Steps :**
- Pull paid **gsearch nonbrand** campaign traffic on **/home** and **/lander-1** pages, trended weekly since 2012-06-01 and the bounce rates.
- Find the first `website_pageview_id` for relavant season with select created_at and filter
- Count page views for each session to identify bounces (`website_pageview_id` = 1)
- Summarize sessions, bounced sessions and bounce rate by week
<br>

**Query :**

```sql
-- Find the first website_pageview_id for relavant season with select created_at and filter
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE landing_page_trend
SELECT
	p.created_at,
	p.website_session_id,
	p.pageview_url AS landing_page,
	MIN(p.website_pageview_id) AS first_landing_page
FROM website_pageviews p

 5 â€” All traffict was directed to home until 2012-06-17, and starting on 2012-08-05, all traffic was directed to lander-1. There has been improvement as the bounce rate decreased from more than 60% to about 50%. The /lander-1 page changes are operating as well.

### ðŸ“Œ **Business Concept: Analyzing and Testing Conversion Funnels**
Conversion funnel analysis is about **understanding and optimizing each step of your userâ€™s experience on their journey toward purchasing your products**

### ðŸ“Œ **Common Use Cases: Analyzing and Testing Conversion Funnels**
- Identifying the most common paths customers take before purchasing your products
- Identifying how many of your users continue on to each next step in your conversion flow, and how many users abandon at each step
- Optimizing critical pain points where users are abandoning, so that you can convert more users and sell more products

When we perform conversion funnel analysis, we will look at each step in our conversion flow to see how many customers drop off and how many continue on at each step.<br>

Build Conversion Funnels for **gsearch nonbrand** traffic from **/lander-1 to /thank you page**.

**Steps :**
- Select all pageviews for relevant session, create pageview level in temporary table, filter to date between **'2012-08-05' and '2012-09-05'**
- Aggregate data to assess funnel performance
- Agregate data to be click rate

**Query :**
